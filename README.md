# Java_amazon_automation

This project is written using Selenium web Automation Framework and Java programming language.
when the code is executed, it will open the Firefox browser and will navigate to the "amazon" website and maximize the web browser.
after that code will search for some random product and find the name and price of all output products in the list.

this program needs Selenium web driver and library to work properly.
dont forget to change the driver path with the path of your driver (code inline 11)

you can change the driver to integrate the program with other browsers by changing the driver (code in line 14).

source codes are under the src folder in the main.java file.

important note: don't forget to add Selenium Library files to the project before executing the code. you can find information about Selenium library files and drivers in any desired YouTube tutorial.

You may need all the files and icons in the added hierarchy for the application in order to work properly.
